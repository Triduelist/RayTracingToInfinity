# RayTracingToInfinity
## What have I added?
- Thread parallelization allowing for up to 4 times faster rendering
- [Super Fast Media Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for result visualization
- New plane and disk hittables
- Cylinders and Cones
- Frosted and colored glass
- X and Z axis rotations
- Render de-noising through [Open-Image-Denoise](https://github.com/OpenImageDenoise/oidn)
- Export to PNG, a filetype more user-friendly than PPM.
- Some code refactoring

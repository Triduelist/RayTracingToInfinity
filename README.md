# RayTracingToInfinity
My spin off of Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/) series.
## What have I added?
- Thread parallelization allowing for up to 4 times faster rendering
- Added [Super Fast Media Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for result visualization
- New plane and disk hittables
- Frosted and colored glass
- Export to PNG, a filetype more user-friendly than PPM.
- Some code refactoring
